This is my work for Lab 1 in my Graph Theory course. In this lab, I have to create an arbitrary acyclic directed graph, using random number generated by Poya-2 distribution (referenced in Vadzinskii's book)

### 
Graph is created with user-input number of vertices as parameter, stored by its adjacency matrix, visualized by NetworkX library
### 
There are also other functions as finding number of paths from one vertex to another, with custom length; and checking and giving out all possible paths connecting 2 vertices 

###
Connecting-path-finding using DFS-recursion, path-finding with length using Shimbell method (addition and multiplication on adjacency matrix)
