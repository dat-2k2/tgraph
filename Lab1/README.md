## Lab 1
This is my work for Lab 1 in my Graph Theory course. In this lab, I have to create an arbitrary acyclic directed graph, using random number generated by Poisson-2 distribution (referenced in Vadzinskii's book)

Acyclic graph has no cycle, so it's constructed as a lattice. Degree of each vertex should be kept at a certain ratio to make graph clearly visible. 

Path finding uses backtracking, which returns **all* possible paths. In fact, Shimbell finds the shortest/longest path so only the found path should be visible.
