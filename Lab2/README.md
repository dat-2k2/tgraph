##Lab 2
This is my work for Lab 2 in Graph Theory Course

In this work, I implemented 3 algos to find shortest path for weighted direct graph: Dijkstra, Bellman - Ford and Floyd - Warshall. All of them take adjacency with weights and source vertex as parameters, and return vector or matrix of shortest path to respective vertices.

I also compared their complexities based on how many of iterations. The complexity had me thought about temporarily storing solutions to quickly take out, leading to "cache" part in the code.
